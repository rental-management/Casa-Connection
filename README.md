#CASA CONNECTION<br/>
This project is a rental property management application for the browser that is geared towards a user with multiple properties and tenants that need to be managed. When building this application, our team sought to achieve a warm and friendly UI that enables a landlord to organize and keep track of data about each of his or her properties. 

##GETTING STARTED
To view this application on your local machine, please clone it down and then install the dependencies listed in the package.json. You can do this easily by running yarn/npm in your terminal:

```
yarn OR npm install -g
```

##Running Unit Tests With Jest
