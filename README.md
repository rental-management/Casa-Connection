CASA CONNECTION<br/> <br />
This project is a rental property management application for the browser that is geared towards a user with multiple properties and tenants that need to be managed. When building this application, our team sought to achieve a warm and friendly UI that enables a landlord to organize and keep track of data about each of his or her properties.
